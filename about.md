## A simple site for top-notch 3d modeling.
Topology Guides was started in 2015 by [Johnson Martin](https://johnsonlm.com/) as a site to share 3d modeling tips and tricks to 3d artists around the world.

## How is the site built?
For those curious, the site is built entirely using markdown on the Jekyll blogging platform and hosted in Github Pages. This means the site is completely static and also open-source under the MIT license.

The site previously was a Tumble blog and briefly moved to Wordpress install before I realized Wordpress was terrible at being efficient and not worth the cost of investment.
