## A simple site to teach top-notch 3d modeling

Topology Guides was started in 2015 as a site to share 3d modeling tips and tricks to 3d artists around the world.

## How is the site built?
For those curious, the site is built entirely using markdown on the Jekyll blogging platform and hosted in Github Pages. This means the site is completely static and also open-source under an MIT license.

The site previously was a Tumble blog and briefly moved to a Wordpress install before I realized Wordpress was horrific at being efficient and was not worth the cost investment.
