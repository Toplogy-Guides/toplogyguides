  <h2 id="a-simple-site-for-top-notch-3d-modeling">A simple site for top-notch 3d modeling.</h2>

  <p>Topology Guides was started in 2015 as a site to share 3d modeling tips and tricks to 3d artists around the world.</p>

  <h2 id="how-is-the-site-built">How is the site built?</h2>

  <p>For those curious, the site is built entirely using markdown on the Jekyll blogging platform and hosted in Github Pages. This means the site is completely static and also open-source under an MIT license.</p>

  <p>The site previously was a Tumble blog and briefly moved to Wordpress install before I realized Wordpress was terrible at being efficient and not worth the cost of investment.</p>
