  <p>Topology Guides was started in 2015 as a site to share 3d modeling tips and tricks to 3d artists around the world.</p>

  <h2 id="how-is-the-site-built">How is the site built?</h2>
  <p>For those curious, the site is built entirely using markdown on the Jekyll blogging platform and hosted in Github Pages. This means the site is completely static and also open-source under an MIT license.</p>

  <p>The site previously was a Tumble blog and briefly moved to a Wordpress install before I realized Wordpress was horrific at being efficient and was not worth the cost investment.</p>
